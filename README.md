# InteractiveFiction

Demos for writing interactive fiction. Used as examples for my students to create simple stories.

Twine is easier to create stories which are decision or dialogue driven whereas Inform7 is more useful to create stories that have more interaction with the environment (like escape games). Beware though, Inform7 takes a while to master. 

To run them download
